# Mozaiks SDK (Placeholder)

This package is reserved for the public client SDK (React/JS helpers) used by external apps.

**Status:** scaffolded but not implemented yet.

If you’re building plugins or the shell UI, you don’t need this package today.

Planned contents:
- Reusable UI components for plugin apps
- React hooks for auth/session/runtime calls
- Typed client helpers for APIs
